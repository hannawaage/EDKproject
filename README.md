Project in the subject TTT4275 (2020 SPRING)

Theme for the project is classification.

In the first task a linear classifier is trained and tested on a data set called Fisherâ€™s Iris data set. The data consists of 50 samples from each of three types of iris flower. Each of these samples contain four measurements: length and width of the petals and sepals.The goal in this task is to design and evaluate the linear classifier, before analyzing the relative importance of each of the four features with respect to linear separability. 

In the second part of the project, the objective was to design and train a template based classifier so that it would be able to classify handwritten numbers between 0 and 9 with good precision. To do so, a given set of training data that consisted of 60000 labeled images of handwritten numbers was used, and a set of 10000 other labeled images was used for testing. All the data was obtained from the MNIST database. In both cases, the Euclidian distance is used as distance measure.
